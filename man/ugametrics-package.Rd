\title{ugametrics: Tools for ECON 4750}
\description{
A collection of tools and utilities developed for the ECON 4750 course at the University of Georgia. Includes methods for regression adjustment.

The ugametrics package provides a formula interface for regression adjustment
estimation to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) for
a binary treatment under the unconfoundedness assumption.
}
\details{
The main function \code{\link{reg_adj_att}} implements outcome regression by:
\enumerate{
\item Estimating a regression model of the outcome on covariates using only
the control group
\item Predicting counterfactual outcomes for the treated group using the
estimated model
\item Computing the ATT as the average difference between observed outcomes
and predicted counterfactual outcomes for the treated group
}

This approach wraps the \code{DRDID::reg_did_panel()} function for
cross-sectional data (no panel structure required).
}
\section{Key Assumption}{

\strong{Unconfoundedness (Selection on Observables):} All variables that
jointly affect treatment assignment and potential outcomes must be observed
and included in the covariate adjustment formula. This is a strong assumption
that cannot be tested from the data alone.
}

\section{Main Function}{

\itemize{
\item \code{\link{reg_adj_att}}: Estimate ATT using regression adjustment
\item \code{\link{reg_adj_ate}}: Estimate ATE using regression adjustment
}
}

\section{Methods}{

\itemize{
\item \code{\link{print.reg_adj}}: Print results
\item \code{\link{summary.reg_adj}}: Detailed summary of results
}
}

\examples{
# Basic example with covariates
result <- reg_adj_att(mpg ~ am, xformula = ~ hp + wt, data = mtcars)
print(result)

# Example without covariates
result_simple <- reg_adj_att(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
summary(result_simple)
