\title{Regression Adjustment Estimation for Binary Treatment Effects (ATE)}
\usage{
reg_adj_ate(formula, xformula = NULL, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula specifying the outcome and treatment variables in the
form \code{Y ~ D}, where \code{Y} is the outcome variable and \code{D} is
the binary treatment indicator.}

\item{xformula}{An optional formula specifying the covariates for adjustment
in the form \code{~X1 + X2 + ...}. If \code{NULL} (default), only an
intercept is included.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables in the model.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{c("reg_adj", "drdid")} aligned with DRDID outputs.
}
\description{
Estimates the average treatment effect (ATE) using regression adjustment
under unconfoundedness. Outcome regression is estimated on the control group
and used to predict counterfactual outcomes for both treated and control
units, averaging appropriately.
