\title{Regression Adjustment Estimation for Binary Treatment Effects}
\usage{
reg_adj(formula, xformula = NULL, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula specifying the outcome and treatment variables in the
form \code{Y ~ D}, where \code{Y} is the outcome variable and \code{D} is
the binary treatment indicator.}

\item{xformula}{An optional formula specifying the covariates for adjustment
in the form \code{~X1 + X2 + ...}. If \code{NULL} (default), only an
intercept is included (unadjusted comparison).}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables in the model.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{c("reg_adj", "drdid")} with the following components:

ATT: The estimated average treatment effect on the treated

se: Standard error of the ATT estimate

uci: Upper bound of the 95\\% confidence interval

lci: Lower bound of the 95\\% confidence interval

boots: Bootstrap draws (NULL when boot = FALSE)

att.inf.func: Influence function (NULL when inffunc = FALSE)

call.param: Matched call parameters

argu: List of arguments used
}
\description{
Estimates the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) using regression
adjustment under the unconfoundedness assumption. This function implements
outcome regression by estimating a model on the control group and predicting
counterfactual outcomes for the treated group.
}
\details{
This function wraps \code{DRDID::reg_did_panel()} for cross-sectional data
by setting the pre-treatment outcome (y0) to zero. The method:
\enumerate{
\item Runs OLS regression of the outcome on covariates using control group data
\item Predicts counterfactual outcomes for the treated group
\item Computes ATT as the difference between observed and predicted outcomes
}

The treatment variable \code{D} can be numeric (0/1), logical (FALSE/TRUE),
or a two-level factor. It will be converted to a numeric 0/1 indicator where
0 represents the control group and 1 represents the treated group.

\strong{Key Assumption:} Unconfoundedness (selection on observables) - all
confounders that affect both treatment assignment and potential outcomes must
be observed and included in \code{xformula}.
}
\note{
Standard errors are computed analytically using the influence function
approach. Bootstrap inference is not currently supported in this wrapper.
