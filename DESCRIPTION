Description: Provides a formula interface for regression adjustment estimation
    to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) for a binary
    treatment under the unconfoundedness assumption (selection on observables).
    This package wraps the DRDID::reg_did_panel() function for cross-sectional
    data by implementing outcome regression on the control group and predicting
    counterfactual outcomes for the treated group.
